When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you have more than one person working on the project from diffeent computers and locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it can take a long time to process all of that data.
