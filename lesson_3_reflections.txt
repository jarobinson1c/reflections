When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you have more than one person working on the project from diffeent computers and locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it can take a long time to process all of that data.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Use clone when you want to work on a repository on your local computer.
	Use branches when you want to try some experimental code or new feature.
	Use forks when you want to clone another repository online and keep the 
	base code at the original source.
