When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you have more than one person working on the project from diffeent computers and locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it can take a long time to process all of that data.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Use clone when you want to work on a repository on your local computer.
	Use branches when you want to try some experimental code or new feature.
	Use forks when you want to clone another repository online and keep the 
	base code at the original source.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So you can compare before you push the changes to the origin.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I don't know what would be easier but I would be very difficult to do this with just 
	plain text files and trying to keep up with all the changes manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

         when you want to test out some experimental code or new features without breaking
         the main branch.
